When you are the expert in the room, it's likely that nobody knows your limits except you. Therefore it's up to you to be accurate and honest about what you can and cannot do.

That'll tweet, right? Let's unpack that a bit.

For many of us, there will come a time when we find ourselves as _the_ expert in the room for a given situation. A problem occurs, and it happens to fall squarely within your domain. All eyes look expectantly at you for a solution. Hesitantly, you offer an answer: "It's going to cost a lot. We need more people to help, and it might take as long as few months to fix."

Silence.

"Really? Isn't there another way?" Instantly, the pressure sets in. The pressure to cave. To compromise what you know to be true and communicate something else. You know what is possible more than they do, but you're being pressured to give a more appealing answer. The temptation to please the crowd is there. Don't give in.

In this context, let's talk about why "no" is temporary but "yes" is forever.

Part of being a junior engineer is learning what is possible. As much as you're learning the technology, you're also learning the what it takes to do execute your craft. Understanding constraints is an intrinsic part of all disciplines of engineering, and software is no exception. As you progress, you get enough of a grasp of not only what is possible, but what _you specifically_ can do. Your own personal constraints are just as important as knowing what is technically possible. Do you have the expertise? Have you done this before?

You will most assuredly end up in a situation where you are pressured to give an answer that is more aggressive than your initial estimate. Maybe it's a shorter timeline or a reduction in cost. Regardless, compromising your expert opinion to please someone will only end in heartache. 

For example, let's look at the imaginary situation above. What if, under pressure from the project manager, you said you could deliver a fix in a month? The PM is now going to base their timelines on what you said, but because you caved to the pressure to please someone else in this situation, you are far more likely to fail to deliver on time. The project will slip, and you're back in the same situation. You've burned some of your goodwill and lost trust. 

Saying "no" and getting some pushback and disappointment is temporary. Saying "yes" and failing to deliver breaks trust and erodes confidence.
